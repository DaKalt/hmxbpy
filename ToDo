Include:
  - Cutout creation (with healpy or ligo.skymaps for correct projection) --> make bands a parameter
  - Cut away dataless parts from LC (especially full LC; probably matplotlib has a command?)
  - variability analysis
  - add bxa (in addition to cstat) and possibly 3ml
  - return spectrum data points as array (for plotting with plt)
  - confidence contours for fitting parameters
