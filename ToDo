Include:
  - Cutout creation (with healpy or ligo.skymaps for correct projection) --> make bands a parameter
  - Cut away dataless parts from LC (especially full LC; probably matplotlib has a command?)
  - make additional models possible (import .xcm file?)
  - variability analysis
  - add bxa (in addition to cstat)
